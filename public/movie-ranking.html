<h1>The Best Movies According to Karen</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Trainspotting</h3>
<p>Timeless classic, capturing a key moment in history and propelling Ewan McGregor into world wide stardom. Superb performance from Robert Caryle as the infamous Begbie.  "Its shite being Scottish"</p>
<h3>Mamma Mia</h3>
<p>All your favourite Abba hits incorporated into an unorthodox love story.  Meryl Streep is excellent but Pierce Brosnan's signing is questionable!</p>
<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>Ultimate Disney classic with unbelievable music.  I defy you to not shed a tear during this masterpiece.</p>
