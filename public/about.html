<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Karen Healy, previously Illsley until I married my lovely wife in 2024.  I'm in my 40s and currently off work as I 
  go through treatment for breast cancer.  I'm using some of my spare time to learn how to develop websites.</p>

<p>We are about to embark on a year long sabbatical and I want to documentthe experience on my own website.  
  I want the freedom to work from any where in the world so learning how to code could enable me to do this.  
  I work in a big corporate in the financial serivces sector and have done for the last 20 years.  Time to do 
  something completely different with my life?  Maybe .</p>

<p>My wife and I love hiking so this is featuring heavily in our sabbatical plans. First stop is Madeira and then 
  we're looking at Canada and Japan.</p>
